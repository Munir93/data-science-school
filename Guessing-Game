The Challenge:

Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:

If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
On a player's first turn, if their guess is
within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!

from random import randint #IMPORTS THE RANDOM INTERGER GENERATOR FROM RANDOM LIBRARY 
print("WELCOME TO GUESS ME!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100")
print("If your guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD")
print("If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM")
print("If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER")
print("If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER")
print("LET'S PLAY!")


num = randint(0,100)   # COMPUTER SELECTS RANDOM NUMBER FROM 0 TO 100
guesses = [0]           # LIST OF GUESSES STARTING WITH 0 AS PACEHOLDER

while True:
    
    guess = int(input('I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100. \n What is your guess '))  #TAKES USER INPUT
    
    if guess == num:
        print(f'Well done you guesses right! It only took you {len(guesses)} guesses')   #COMPARES GUESS TO COMP NUMBER
        break
    if guess < 1 or guess > 100:                                                        # SETS LIMITS
        print('Sorry out of bounds!')
        continue 
        
    guesses.append(guess)                                                               #ADDS EACH NEW GUESS TO LIST OF GUESSES
    
    if guesses[-2]:
        if abs(num-guess) < abs(num-guesses[-2]):                                       # COMPARES LAST GUESS TO CURRENT GUESS
            print('your getting warmer!')
        else:
            print('your getting colder')
    else:
        if abs(num-guess) <= 10:                                                     #IF GUESS IS LESS THAN 10 AWAY 
            print('warm!')
        else:
            print('cold')
